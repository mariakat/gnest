        <h2 class="mb-5">1. Why a Global Network?</h2>
        <h3 class="mb-4">The Network's mission is</h3>
        <p>To support, assist and influence those who seek to conserve and improve the natural and built environments
          and to improve quality of life through the development and application of environmental science, technology
          and policy</p>

        <p>The Global Network of Environmental Science and Technology (Global NEST) has been initiated as a response to
          the growing interest of the International community attending the conferences on Environmental Science and
          Technology, organised on a biennial basis by the University of the Aegean. This interest mainly concentrates
          on serving the above mission through common understanding and necessary action.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">2. What does the Network aim to achieve?</h2>

        <h3 class="mb-4">The Network has wide-ranging aims and objectives which cover:</h3>
        <p>Advancing the study of environmental science, technology and policy
          the widest-possible dissemination of knowledge in the fields of environmental science, technology and policy
          exchanging information between academics and between academia, business, industry, policy makers and the
          general public
          bringing together scientists, technologists, engineers and others for discussion of areas of concern
          influencing policy makers, business leaders and the general public
          liaising with and cooperating with other organisations worldwide with similar aims and objectives.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">3. How will the Network be organised?</h2>
        <p>Although legal formalities have to be completed to formally create the Network as a formal association, it is
          proposed that a decision will be taken at the 5th Conference on Environmental Science and Technology by the
          first members of Global NEST to appoint an interim Executive Committee.</p>

        <p>At least initially, the Network will be headquartered in Greece, though national groupings will be encouraged
          as well. In addition to the Executive Committee, it is planned that there will be an Advisory Council
          comprising one representative from each country in which there are Network Members. This Advisory Council will
          provide the Executive Committee with invaluable input from members on the running of the Network and provide a
          first line of contact with each country.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-4">The Interim Executive Committee is:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Prof. Th. Lekkas - Acting Chairman</li>
          <li> Mr. Roger Venables - Vice Chairman (Development)</li>
          <li> Dr. Dionysis Assimacopoulos - Vice Chairman (Editions)</li>
          <li> Dr. Kimon Hadjibiros - Vice Chairman (Events)</li>
